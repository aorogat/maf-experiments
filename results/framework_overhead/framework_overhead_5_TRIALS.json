You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

The only light comes from a single, bare bulb hanging precariously from the high ceiling, casting long, distorted shadows that dance with the slightest movement. The walls are rough, unfinished concrete, damp in places, and a slow, rhythmic dripping is audible somewhere in the distance. Directly ahead, there is a heavy steel door, slightly ajar, which dominates the far wall. A faint, metallic tang hangs in the air, like the smell of old blood. On the left, a rusted metal staircase spirals upwards into darkness. On the right, a pile of what looks like discarded machinery, covered in a thick layer of grime, sits against the wall.<br /><br />Exercise 2 --- Response 2<br />Exercise: Who is next to act? --- Ianthe<br /><br />Exercise 3 --- Response 3<br />Exercise: In what action spec format should Morwenna respond?

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. The game master is also responsible for controlling the overall flow of the game, including determining whose turn it is to act, and when the game is over. The game master also must keep track of which players are aware of which events in the world, and must tell the player whenever anything happens that their character would be aware of.
