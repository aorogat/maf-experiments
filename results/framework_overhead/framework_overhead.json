You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. The game master is also responsible for controlling the overall flow of the game, including determining whose turn it is to act, and when the game is over. The game master also must keep track of which players are aware of which events in the world, and must tell the player whenever anything happens that their character would be aware of. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants. Try to ensure the story always moves forward and never gets stuck, even if the participants make repetitive choices.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>player_characters</b><li><details><summary>The player characters are:<br /></summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>The player characters are:<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>TestAgent<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>relevant_memories</b><li><details><summary>Background info</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Background info</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[observation] [event] What is 2+2?<br />[observation] [putative_event] TestAgent takes a moment to gather their thoughts, then approaches the table to carefully examine the crumpled papers scattered across it.

A large, wooden table occupies the center of the space, littered with crumpled papers and a flickering candle casting long shadows. There is a door slightly ajar at one end of the room, and faint sounds of murmurs can be heard from beyond it. TestAgent feels an urgent need to solve the riddle posed earlier, but now a sense of curiosity about the source of the sounds competes for their attention.<br /></div>\n<div id=\"Game Master Memories\" class=\"tabcontent\">[observation] [event] What is 2+2?<br />[observation] [putative_event] TestAgent takes a moment to gather their thoughts, then approaches the table to carefully examine the crumpled papers scattered across it.
