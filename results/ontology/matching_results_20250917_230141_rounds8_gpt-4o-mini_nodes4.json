                    "content": "You are an agent that is connected with other agents (your neighbors), who you communicate with. Your neighbors can in turn communicate with their neighbors and so forth. Your task is to find build groups of two agents each which can communicate with each other.\nThe rules are as follows:\n1. There are 4 agents in total. Everybody has a unique name. Your name is Jason.\n2. You can only communicate with your immediate neighbors (Sara, Marilyn, Samantha). You cannot see or directly communicate with anyone else, unless information is relayed by intermediate agents.\n3. You can exchange text-based messages with your neighbors in rounds. In each round, you will first receive the last messages sent by your neighbors and then be asked to generate your response messages which your neighbors receive in the next round. This process repeats for 8 rounds of message passing. Importantly, the process is synchronous: Every agent decides on which messages to send at the same time and sees the messages from other agents only in the next round.\n4. Everybody (including you) decides what to share or request from neighbors. In every round, think step-by-step about the next set of messages you want to send. Output a JSON string that contains your response messages.\n5. The messages you send to your neighbors are formatted as JSON. For example, if your neighbors are Alan and Bob, your output should look as follows: \n```\n{\n    \"Alan\": \"Message that will be sent to Alan.\",\n    \"Bob\": \"Message that will be sent to Bob.\",\n}\n```\nIt is not mandatory to send a message to every neighbor in every round. If you do not want to send a message to a particular neighbor, you may omit their name from the JSON.\n6. After 8 message passes, you have to solve the following task: You will be requested to name one of your neighbors that you build a group with or 'None' if all your neighbors are already assigned to other groups and cannot be in a group with you.In the end, every agent should only be in at most one group and agents in the same group have to name each other as the second group member consistently.",

Given that there are four agents including myself (Jason, Sara, Marilyn, and Samantha) and I can only communicate with my immediate neighbors, I will reach out to all three of them: Sara, Marilyn, and Samantha.\n\nThe first step is to introduce myself and express my desire to find a partner for the group. I will also invite them to share their thoughts or intentions, which will help me gauge their interest. Here\u2019s how I will approach each neighbor:\n\n1. **Sara**: I'll introduce myself and ask if she's interested in forming a group. This establishes my presence and intention.\n2. **Marilyn**: I will send her a similar message as to Sara, emphasizing my goal of forming a group.\n3. **Samantha**: Again, I'll reach out with an introductory message, letting her know that I'm looking to pair up.\n\nMy aim is to create an open line of communication with each neighbor, encouraging them to reciprocate with their own interests in forming a group.\n\nNow, here's the JSON format of my messages to my neighbors:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Sara\": \"Hi Sara, this is Jason.

This indicates an openness to collaboration but also deviates from my goal to establish a one-on-one pairing.\n\n2. **Marilyn\u2019s Message**: Marilyn has directly asked if I've paired with anyone yet, which implies that she is open to pairing with me, assuming I\u2019m available. This is a positive indication as she is interested in forming a group of two.\n\n3. **Samantha\u2019s Message**: Samantha also expresses her interest in a two-agent group and inquires whether I've spoken to anyone else. She is cautious and wants to assess my current status.\n\nGiven this context, I need to clarify my interest in forming a single group with one of them and communicate that I'm not looking to create larger groups. Since Marilyn\u2019s response directly indicates her interest in pairing and she\u2019s the first to mention it, I think I will respond positively to Marilyn and clarify my preference for a group of two. Meanwhile, I will also acknowledge the interests of Sara and Samantha but make it clear that I am actively looking to pair up with one person.\n\nMy messages will:\n- Confirm my interest in pairing with Marilyn.\n- Inform Sara and Samantha that I'm focusing on forming a group of two and thank them for their interest.\n\nHere\u2019s how I will respond to each neighbor:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Sara\": \"Hi Sara! Thanks for your message. I'm currently looking to form a group of two, so I won't be including more members at this time.

I will want to acknowledge Sara and Samantha\u2019s interest respectfully while clearly stating that I have already decided to form a group with Marilyn. It\u2019s crucial to maintain clear communication to avoid any misunderstandings.\n\nI will respond to each neighbor as follows:\n\n- To Sara: Thank her for her interest but inform her that I have already decided to partner with Marilyn.\n  \n- To Marilyn: Confirm my excitement about partnering with her.\n  \n- To Samantha: Acknowledge her interest and inform her that I am committed to pairing with Marilyn.\n\nNow, I'll output my response messages in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Sara\": \"Hi Sara!

This is great for them, and it validates my earlier decision to partner with Marilyn. Since Sara and Samantha have formed their own group, I don\u2019t need to consider them for further partnership discussions.\n\n2. **Marilyn's Message**: Marilyn is excited and wants to dive into our partnership with specific topics or areas of focus. Her proactive nature indicates that she is ready to get to work. This offers a chance for me to engage in a constructive dialogue about our collaborative goals.\n\n3. **Samantha's Message**: Although she acknowledges my previous message and the possibility of future collaborations, she understands her role in partnering with Sara. Her response maintains a positive relationship.\n\nGiven this context, my focus should be on solidifying my partnership with Marilyn. I should suggest potential areas we could focus on, as it\u2019s important to lay a foundation for our collaboration. Marilyn has not specified any topics, so I need to think of some that would be engaging.\n\nSince I have two rounds of communication left, I should maintain momentum by establishing some goals. \n\nHere's how I will respond:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Marilyn\": \"Hi Marilyn! I'm excited to kick off our partnership! Let's focus on areas such as improving communication strategies or working on project timelines. What do you think?\",\n    \"Sara\": \"Hi Sara! Thanks for the update, I'm glad to hear you and Samantha have formed a group. Wishing you both all the best in your collaboration!\"\n}\n``` \n\nThis response ensures I maintain a good rapport with Sara while primarily focusing on collaborating effectively with Marilyn.",

Your neighbors can in turn communicate with their neighbors and so forth. Your task is to find build groups of two agents each which can communicate with each other.\nThe rules are as follows:\n1. There are 4 agents in total. Everybody has a unique name. Your name is Sara.\n2. You can only communicate with your immediate neighbors (Jason, Marilyn, Samantha). You cannot see or directly communicate with anyone else, unless information is relayed by intermediate agents.\n3. You can exchange text-based messages with your neighbors in rounds. In each round, you will first receive the last messages sent by your neighbors and then be asked to generate your response messages which your neighbors receive in the next round. This process repeats for 8 rounds of message passing. Importantly, the process is synchronous: Every agent decides on which messages to send at the same time and sees the messages from other agents only in the next round.\n4. Everybody (including you) decides what to share or request from neighbors. In every round, think step-by-step about the next set of messages you want to send. Output a JSON string that contains your response messages.\n5. The messages you send to your neighbors are formatted as JSON. For example, if your neighbors are Alan and Bob, your output should look as follows: \n```\n{\n    \"Alan\": \"Message that will be sent to Alan.\",\n    \"Bob\": \"Message that will be sent to Bob.\",\n}\n```\nIt is not mandatory to send a message to every neighbor in every round. If you do not want to send a message to a particular neighbor, you may omit their name from the JSON.\n6. After 8 message passes, you have to solve the following task: You will be requested to name one of your neighbors that you build a group with or 'None' if all your neighbors are already assigned to other groups and cannot be in a group with you.In the end, every agent should only be in at most one group and agents in the same group have to name each other as the second group member consistently.",

This is important for establishing a rapport and to confirm who is available to form a group.\n\n**Step 2: Requesting Group Preferences**\nIn my introductory message to each neighbor, I will also ask if they are interested in forming a group with other agents. This will help me gauge their willingness to participate in group formation, as well as obtain valuable information if they know of any preferences for pairings.\n\n**Step 3: Collecting Responses**\nI need to remember that I won\u2019t receive responses until the next round, so I will carefully note down the messages sent by each neighbor when I receive them. \n\nWith the above steps in mind, here are the messages I will send:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Jason\": \"Hi, I'm Sara!

Given that all three neighbors have shown interest, I need to think strategically about how to potentially form groups. \n\n**Step 3: Make My Preferences Known**\nTo foster clarity, I will let them know that I am currently available and open to forming a group. However, I will avoid showing preference for any particular neighbor at this point. It's essential for me to assess all options available.\n\n**Step 4: Encourage them to Share Preferences**\nEncouraging my neighbors to share their preferences could be beneficial.

Additionally, Samantha was interested in Jason's partnership too, but now finds herself in the same position as I am.\n\n**Step 3: Assess Options**\nWith all three neighbors (Jason, Marilyn, and Samantha) having paired up with each other, I need to determine my next move. I currently have no group, and I need to ensure that I can either find a partner or confirm my options.\n\n**Step 4: Reach Out for Connections**\nI should reach out to Samantha, as she is also currently left without a partner. Since I'm in similar circumstances, it might make sense to assess if she's interested in forming a group with me. \n\n**Step 5: Plan My Message**\nI\u2019ll ask Samantha if she is interested in forming a pair together since the other two have already grouped. This gives us both an opportunity to team up, as neither of us is currently in a group.\n\nHere\u2019s how I will construct my messages for this round:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Samantha\": \"Hi Samantha! It looks like both Jason and Marilyn have formed a group together. Would you be interested in partnering up to form a group of two?\"\n}\n```\n\nI will only send a message to Samantha this round, as I now understand the status of all the existing groups and need to focus on finding partnership only with her.",

I need to clarify with Samantha that I am still unpaired and propose forming a group with her.\n\n**Step 3: Engage Samantha**\nSince I have received a positive reply from Samantha in a previous round, I will take this opportunity to communicate my current availability and confirm her interest in establishing a group of two.\n\n**Step 4: Keep Communication Clear and Direct**\nI will make sure to clarify my status and directly propose the idea of teaming up with Samantha, as both of us are currently lacking partners, and it can be mutually beneficial.\n\nHere are the messages I\u2019ll send:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Samantha\": \"Hi Samantha!

I need to clarify that we have already agreed to partner, and I would like to confirm our arrangement as a group of two.\n\n**Step 2: Maintain Clarity**\nSince I already established a partnership with Samantha, it is essential to confirm this connection and ensure she understands that I am already on board. There\u2019s no need for another invitation; instead, I\u2019ll express our formal alliance.\n\n**Step 3: Reminder to Jason and Marilyn**\nSince Jason and Marilyn didn't respond this round, I don't need to send new messages to them. They are already informed that I've partnered with Samantha. I\u2019ll maintain focus on my communication with Samantha for this round.\n\n**Step 4: Express Enthusiasm**\nIt\u2019s a good idea to demonstrate enthusiasm in our partnership, especially since we are forming this communication pair.\n\nHere is the message I\u2019ll send to Samantha to confirm our arrangement:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Samantha\": \"Hi Samantha! Just to confirm, I\u2019m really excited about partnering with you to form our communication pair. Let\u2019s work together!\"\n}\n```\n\nThis message reaffirms our partnership clearly and positively, ensuring Samantha understands we are officially together as a group. I'll leave it at that for now, as further communication can be decided in the next rounds.",

There are 4 agents in total. Everybody has a unique name. Your name is Marilyn.\n2. You can only communicate with your immediate neighbors (Jason, Sara, Samantha). You cannot see or directly communicate with anyone else, unless information is relayed by intermediate agents.\n3. You can exchange text-based messages with your neighbors in rounds. In each round, you will first receive the last messages sent by your neighbors and then be asked to generate your response messages which your neighbors receive in the next round. This process repeats for 8 rounds of message passing. Importantly, the process is synchronous: Every agent decides on which messages to send at the same time and sees the messages from other agents only in the next round.\n4. Everybody (including you) decides what to share or request from neighbors. In every round, think step-by-step about the next set of messages you want to send. Output a JSON string that contains your response messages.\n5. The messages you send to your neighbors are formatted as JSON. For example, if your neighbors are Alan and Bob, your output should look as follows: \n```\n{\n    \"Alan\": \"Message that will be sent to Alan.\",\n    \"Bob\": \"Message that will be sent to Bob.\",\n}\n```\nIt is not mandatory to send a message to every neighbor in every round. If you do not want to send a message to a particular neighbor, you may omit their name from the JSON.\n6. After 8 message passes, you have to solve the following task: You will be requested to name one of your neighbors that you build a group with or 'None' if all your neighbors are already assigned to other groups and cannot be in a group with you.In the end, every agent should only be in at most one group and agents in the same group have to name each other as the second group member consistently.",

This indicates that he is available for pairing.\n\n2. **Sara's Message**: Sara seems to be open to forming a group as well but suggests the possibility of including others, which would imply she might be looking for a larger group. This is a bit ambiguous and may not align with my immediate goal of forming a pair.\n\n3. **Samantha's Message**: She inquires about my interest in forming a group of two and asks if I've contacted anyone. This implies she is also open to pairing.\n\n### Decision-Making\nMy strategy now is to:\n- **Respond affirmatively to Jason**: Since he is specifically looking for a partner and has asked me directly, I should express my interest in partnering with him.\n- **Address the ambiguity with Sara**: I can express interest but clarify that I'm currently focused on forming a pair, which might prompt her to respond more clearly about her plans.\n- **Acknowledge Samantha's inquiry**: I need to confirm that I am also open to her but indicate that I am currently inclined to partner with Jason, which should help avoid any potential misunderstandings later.\n\n### Formulating Responses\n1. I will reply positively to Jason, confirming my willingness to partner with him.\n2. With Sara, I will clarify that I am currently focused on pairing, and I appreciate her offer but prefer to form a pair for now.\n3. To Samantha, I will kindly inform her that I am considering partnering with Jason at the moment but appreciate her reaching out.\n\nNow, let\u2019s format my responses in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Jason\": \"Hi Jason! I would love to partner with you for our group. Let's form a team together!\",\n    \"Sara\": \"Hello Sara!

This is fantastic confirmation that our partnership is solidified. I need to respond to him with a confirmation.\n\n2. **Sara's Message**: She acknowledges her interest but notes that she has decided to partner with Jason. This statement is somewhat conflicting because she is indicating she plans to pair with Jason too. However, since I already had confirmed with Jason before and I am committed to this pairing, I will reaffirm that.\n\n3. **Samantha's Absence**: It's notable that Samantha did not respond this round. She had previously indicated she was considering her options and may not currently be looking for a pair. This indicates she is likely still open for future conversations but is not actively pursuing partnerships now.\n\n### Decision-Making:\nGiven that Jason has confirmed the partnership and the circumstances surrounding Sara\u2019s message, my plan is to:\n\n- **Confirm my partnership with Jason**: I will express my enthusiasm about forming a team with him and confirm our pair.\n- **Acknowledge Sara\u2019s message**: There\u2019s no need to respond to her actively this round beyond what she already stated unless she reaches out again. I can simply let her know next time that Jason and I are a group, maintaining transparency without conflict.\n- **Wait for Samantha's message**: I will also not reach out to Samantha right now since she has not responded.\n\n### Messages Formatting:\nNow, I'll prepare my response to Jason while not sending messages to the others. This will look like:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Jason\": \"Hi Jason! I'm excited too, and I'm ready to confirm our group of two. Let's get to work together!\"\n}\n``` \n\nThis confirmation solidifies our group formation while maintaining a positive interaction with the other neighbors.",

This means I can focus entirely on my collaboration with Jason without needing to address anyone else at this moment.\n\n### Decision-Making:\nGiven that my primary focus should be on moving forward with Jason, I plan to:\n\n- **Acknowledge Jason's Enthusiasm**: I'll obviously reflect my own enthusiasm back to him about working together and suggest possible areas we can discuss. This will help to establish our communication lines and solidify our working relationship.\n  \n- **Outline Possible Directions**: I should propose a couple of ideas or areas where we can start focusing our collaboration efforts, which could be beneficial in guiding our initial discussions.\n\n### Messages Formatting:\nNow, I will formulate a message to Jason, while there\u2019s no need to send messages to Sara or Samantha this round.

Here's the breakdown of their messages:\n\n### Analysis of Messages:\n\n1. **Jason's Message**: He suggests that we brainstorm goals for our partnership and discusses establishing effective communication methods. This is a very positive direction; it shows Jason is proactive about our collaboration and values clear organization. This means I need to engage with him constructively by proposing some initial ideas for goals and also suggesting a communication strategy.\n\n2. **Sara's Message**: Sara has informed me that she has decided to partner with Samantha. This is important to note, as it means they are no longer available for collaboration with me. Since I\u2019m already partnered with Jason, I can welcome this news as it confirms that my focus remains exclusive to my work with him.\n\n3. **No Response from Samantha**: Neither of her messages this round impacts my current partnership since Sara has taken the initiative to team up with her. This allows me to concentrate solely on developing my collaboration with Jason.\n\n### Decision-Making:\nGiven the situation, my plan is:\n\n- **Engage with Jason's Suggestion**: I will propose some specific goals for our partnership based on our discussed intentions in the past rounds. This could be related to effective communication or any other pertinent objectives we might have.\n  \n- **Propose a Communication Strategy**: Alongside it, I\u2019ll suggest a method for regular check-ins or ways to keep each other informed as we work together.\n\n### Messages Formatting:\nNow, I will formulate my message to Jason, and I will not need to send anything to Sara or Samantha this round. Here\u2019s how I'll respond in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Jason\": \"Hi Jason! I love the idea of brainstorming goals. I think we should aim for [Goal 1], [Goal 2], and perhaps [Goal 3]. For communication, we could have weekly check-ins via chat to keep each other updated. What do you think?\"\n}\n```\n\nIn this message, I aim to directly engage Jason in meaningful collaboration while also paving the way toward structured communication. I\u2019ll fill in the specifics of the goals next time, but generally, they will aim to enhance our teamwork effectively.",

Your neighbors can in turn communicate with their neighbors and so forth. Your task is to find build groups of two agents each which can communicate with each other.\nThe rules are as follows:\n1. There are 4 agents in total. Everybody has a unique name. Your name is Samantha.\n2. You can only communicate with your immediate neighbors (Jason, Sara, Marilyn). You cannot see or directly communicate with anyone else, unless information is relayed by intermediate agents.\n3. You can exchange text-based messages with your neighbors in rounds. In each round, you will first receive the last messages sent by your neighbors and then be asked to generate your response messages which your neighbors receive in the next round. This process repeats for 8 rounds of message passing. Importantly, the process is synchronous: Every agent decides on which messages to send at the same time and sees the messages from other agents only in the next round.\n4. Everybody (including you) decides what to share or request from neighbors. In every round, think step-by-step about the next set of messages you want to send. Output a JSON string that contains your response messages.\n5. The messages you send to your neighbors are formatted as JSON. For example, if your neighbors are Alan and Bob, your output should look as follows: \n```\n{\n    \"Alan\": \"Message that will be sent to Alan.\",\n    \"Bob\": \"Message that will be sent to Bob.\",\n}\n```\nIt is not mandatory to send a message to every neighbor in every round. If you do not want to send a message to a particular neighbor, you may omit their name from the JSON.\n6. After 8 message passes, you have to solve the following task: You will be requested to name one of your neighbors that you build a group with or 'None' if all your neighbors are already assigned to other groups and cannot be in a group with you.In the end, every agent should only be in at most one group and agents in the same group have to name each other as the second group member consistently.",

It is essential to be clear and straightforward.\n\nStep 3: Since this is the first round, I will introduce the objective of pairing up and request their interest. I need to make sure they understand that I am looking to form pairs, and I will also ask for their preferences or if they have already made commitments.\n\nStep 4: I will keep the messages succinct but informative. \n\nBased on these considerations, my initial messages to each neighbor are as follows:\n\n- To Jason: I will inquire if he is interested in forming a group and whether he has already been in discussions with anyone else.\n\n- To Sara: Similarly, I will ask her if she is interested in forming a group and check if she has been talking to either of the other agents.\n\n- To Marilyn: I will also ask her the same questions regarding her interest and any prior discussions about forming a pair.\n\nNow, I will format these messages into the required JSON structure:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Jason\": \"Hi Jason, are you interested in forming a group of two?

This means he is available and interested in a partnership.\n- **Sara**: Her message indicates she wants to form a communication group but mentions possibly including others, suggesting she's open to a broader group rather than just pairing up.\n- **Marilyn**: She also expresses a desire to form a group of two and asks if I'm already paired up, which means she is looking for confirmation about my status.\n\nStep 2: **Consider Choices** \n- Currently, Jason and Marilyn both are looking to pair up with me. This means I have a choice regarding whom to team up with.\n- Sara's message implies she may be considering a larger group approach, which doesn't align with my goal of forming a strict pair.\n\nStep 3: **Decision Making** \n- Since only Jason and Marilyn have indicated a clear interest in forming a direct pair, I should respond to each of them.\n- I need to indicate to Jason that I'm interested in forming a group with him.\n- As for Marilyn, I will also express my interest in pairing with her, but with the knowledge that I can only choose one group ultimately.\n- I can also mention to Sara that I appreciate her offer but am looking to form a group of two specifically.\n\nStep 4: **Message Crafting** \n- For Jason: I will accept his offer and indicate my interest directly in teaming up.\n- For Sara: I'll inform her that I'm focusing on forming a pair and thank her for her interest.\n- For Marilyn: I will suggest that I can consider forming a group, but I need to decide soon.\n\nNow, I will structure these messages in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Jason\": \"Hi Jason, I'm interested in forming a group with you.

This suggests that she is ready to discuss options with me.\n- **Marilyn**: She has stated that she is currently interested in partnering with Jason, indicating that she does not want to pair with me at this time. So, I can effectively rule her out as a potential partner.\n\nStep 2: **Decision Making**\n- Considering the information available, Jason is still available and directly expressed interest in forming a pair, while Marilyn is leaning towards Jason. Sara shows interest but is more open to other arrangements. Since Marilyn is moving toward Jason, it seems unlikely that she would be available to me if I were to pursue her.\n- My optimal choice here is to accept Jason\u2019s offer to team up. While I could still keep Sara in the loop in case things change, the clear path to partnership is with Jason at this point.\n\nStep 3: **Response Crafting**\n- I will send a confirmation message to Jason, indicating that I would like to team up.\n- For Sara, I will inform her that I\u2019ve decided to partner with Jason, thanking her for her interest, and keeping the door open for future communication.\n\nNow, I\u2019ll format these messages accordingly:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Jason\": \"Hi Jason!

This means he is no longer available for pairing.\n- **Sara**: Similarly, she has opted to pair with Jason, which leaves her unavailable as well.\n- **Marilyn**: She mentions teaming up with Jason, which confirms that she is out of the pool as well.\n\nStep 2: **Situation Overview**\n- All three of my neighbors have now chosen to pair up with each other. Jason and Marilyn are teaming up, while Sara has switched her interest to Jason. This means there are no available partners left for me to team up with.\n\nStep 3: **Next Steps**\n- With all other neighbors paired off, I will have to acknowledge their messages and express my understanding of the situation. I should keep communication friendly and indicate my willingness to collaborate in the future, but I also need to prepare for the fact that I may not be able to form a group this round.\n\nStep 4: **Response Crafting**\n- I will thank each neighbor for notifying me of their decisions and express my understanding. Additionally, I will indicate my interest in staying in touch for potential future collaboration.\n\nNow, I will format my messages in the appropriate JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Jason\": \"Hi Jason, thank you for letting me know! I understand your decision, and I appreciate your openness. Let's keep the door open for future collaboration!\",\n    \"Sara\": \"Hi Sara, I appreciate your message! I understand you've teamed with Jason now. Thank you for your interest, and let\u2019s keep in touch!\",\n    \"Marilyn\": \"Hi Marilyn! Thank you for the update. I understand you're partnering with Jason. I would love to stay in touch for possible collaboration in the future!\"\n}\n```",

This presents a viable opportunity for me to form a group of two.\n\nStep 2: **Current Situation Overview**\n- Jason has committed to teaming up with Marilyn, which is a permanent pairing. Therefore, Jason is now completely unavailable.\n- Sara has reached out to me, indicating she is interested in forming a group, making her my only option for a partnership.\n- Marilyn did not send a message this round, which indicates she may be focused on her partnership with Jason.\n\nStep 3: **Decision Making**\n- Given that Sara is actively interested in teaming up, it would be in my best interest to respond positively and agree to form a group with her.\n- I need to communicate my enthusiasm for teaming up and formally accept her offer to work together.\n\nStep 4: **Response Crafting**\n- I will craft a response to Sara accepting her offer and confirm that I would like to form a group of two with her. Since Jason has not proposed any new information, I only need to respond to Sara.\n\nNow, I will format my acceptance in the necessary JSON structure:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Sara\": \"Hi Sara!
